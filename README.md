# 1703DiscordBot

WhaleWatcher is a PlanetSide 2 stat tracker designed to track both character and outfit wide statistics for short, 1-3 hour sessions. 

The tracker is written in Python3, and the eventual goal is to have it be fully integrated as a Discord bot, where you can start and stop sessions via commands, and then have session stats formatted and printed out afterwards. 

It was used to track various stats during Outfit Wars Season 2, and our current development goal is to continue down the avenue of having a fully functional tracker with all the features we want before converting it be bot friendly. And yes we know that a refactor of a fully fledged tracker is crazy, but that is what the situation demands.
